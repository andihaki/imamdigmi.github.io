Hi! I'm Imam. I'm a computer science student at STMIK AKAKOM Yogyakarta. I love reading about, thinking about, designing, building, and most of all, understanding low-level systems, and programming languages. I spend my time researching topics related to artificial intelligence and programming languages at Digmi.
